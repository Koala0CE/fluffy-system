### Primary Goals and Functionalities

The main goal of the application is to create a personal timeline with photos and memories from my life, accessible only to specific users. Key functionalities include:

#### User Authentication and Authorization

Utilizing Auth0 for secure user login and role-based access control, allowing access only to friends and family.

#### Content Management

Integrating Contentful as a headless CMS to manage and deliver private photos and content.

#### Dynamic Content Display

Randomly displaying a set of public photos to unauthorized users while ensuring private photos are only accessible to authenticated users.

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const data = await fetchContentfulData();
      setContentfulData(data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Failed to fetch data:", error);
      setContentfulData(dummyData); // Fallback to dummy data in case of error
    }
    setIsLoading(false);
  };

  const hasFriendsAndFamilyRole = checkUserRole(user);
  setIsFriendsAndFamily(hasFriendsAndFamilyRole);

  if (hasFriendsAndFamilyRole) {
    fetchData();
  } else {
    setContentfulData(dummyData);
    setTimeout(() => setIsLoading(false), 1000);
  }
}, [user]);
```

#### Static Site Hosting

Deploying the application on GitHub Pages for simplicity and ease of use.

### Future Plans

I plan to expand the application's UI by incorporating an interactive Earth globe. This globe will feature puzzle pieces representing different countries, highlighting the countries I have visited with active pieces. Each active piece will showcase photos and memories from that country, providing a visual and engaging way to explore my travels.

### Challenges and Solutions

#### Challenge: Implementing Secure Authentication and Authorization

**Solution:** I chose Auth0 for its robust security features and seamless integration with React and Next.js. I created roles and permissions to ensure only friends and family can access private photos, while public users see a set of random photos.

#### Challenge: Managing Private Content Efficiently

**Solution:** Contentful was selected as the CMS due to its flexible API and secure content delivery capabilities. I used Contentful’s API to fetch and render content based on user authentication status.

#### Challenge: Deploying a Static Site with Dynamic Content

**Solution:** I opted for Vercel to host the application, leveraging its seamless integration with GitHub for continuous deployment. The application dynamically renders content based on the user’s authentication status, ensuring privacy and dynamic content display.

Using Vercel allows for easy deployment of the Next.js application, which handles both static and dynamic content effectively. Auth0 is used for authentication, ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible to authenticated users. The dynamic content includes personalized data fetched from Contentful, a headless CMS, ensuring that each user sees content relevant to their authentication status.
